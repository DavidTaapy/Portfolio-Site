# Portfolio-Site

The following site is made with the goal of consolidating my HTML and CSS knowledge while creating a personal site for myself! I followed the tutorial by Web Cifar on youtube which can be found at the following link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFQkb26UD1Y&t=1975s!

The website is fully responsive as it changes the view according to the device-width that the user is currently on such as having differing headers as well as layout!

The link to my personal site is https://davidtaapy.github.io/Portfolio-Site/!
